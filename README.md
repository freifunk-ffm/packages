This repository holds all packages from Freifunk Frankfurt that are meant to be
used with the gluon firmware.

---

*** USE OF BRANCHES ***
=======================
 **If the same package name is in different branches, the gluon build system
 can not determine which branch to use**.
 
Branches should only be used to determine the build-surrounding, so there can
be one branch for gluon 2017.1.x and one for 2018.1, ... The master branch
should always work for the latest gluon branch.
